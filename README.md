Welcome to Bingo! 

The code herein is a super-simple implementation of a bingo simulation to help model probabilistic outcomes of different game scenarios, largely based on the number of cards in play and the number of draws.

This is completely free of license, as I cannot imagine a scenario where someone would actually profit from having access to this.

Enjoy!
